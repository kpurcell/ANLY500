## Data Science (Again!)

```{r pie, echo=TRUE}

slices <- c(80, 10,5,5)
lbls <- c("Munging", "EDA", "Modeling", "Reporting")
pie(slices, labels = lbls, main="What is 'Munging'")
```

## Data munging


```{r munging, echo=FALSE, fig.height=5, fig.width=5}

slices <- c(20,20,20,20,20)
lbls <- c("import", "formatting", "integration", "summary", "visualization")
pie(slices, labels = lbls, main="What is 'Munging'")
```

## Data munging

- The process by which an analyist collects, organizes and maps data for downstream analysis.  
- Definitions vary, some include EDA in munging.
- Overall, I deliniate **munging** as the tasks that must be undertake in order to work with the relevant data.
- Important goal is to automate to the greatest extent possible (crucial for all phases of analytical work)
- Hence, `R` or other programitic approaches

## Munging challanges

- **import** challanges of importing data from disparate databases and legacy formats
- **formatting** converting data to approapriate formats, converting vectors to be recognized as dates, or categorical variables, or spatial coordinates, etc.
- **integration** often data will be stored/collected differently, ie. different spatio-temporal resolutions that require integration.
- **summary** what is missing? Is there a data dictionary? How was it collected?
- **visualiation** does the data make sense?  Often require visual inspections.  Big challange as data sets explode in size!
