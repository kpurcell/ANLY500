# ANOVA


## Industry example
<!---
This came from http://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/a-b-testing-experiments-examples
SimCity 5, one of EAâ€™s most popular video games, sold 1.1 million copies in the first two weeks of its launch last year. 50% of sales were digital downloads, thanks to a strong A/B testing strategy.  The test was a comparison of offering a promotional banner ad.  One variation removed the promotional offer from the page altogether. The test lead to some very surprising results: The variation with no offer messaging whatsoever drove 43.4% more purchases. Turns out people really just wanted to buy the game no extra incentive necessary.Most people believe that direct promotions drive purchases, but for EA, this turned out to be totally false. Testing gave them the information needed to maximize revenue in a way that would not have been otherwise possible.

## Application Question
- What test would you use to compare the average conversion rate for sites with and without the promotional banner ad?

>- This A/B scenario would be evaluated using a `t.test()` or some variant.


## A/B/n
- This is a version of scenario testing similar to A/B testing except that $>2$ scenarios are being considered.
- The difference between A/B testing and A/B/n (MVT) testing is in the magnitude of the comparison.
- A/B tests are used for comparing large changes or options
- A/B/n tests are for increased subtly and for evaluating the role of interactions.


## A/B/n --> ANOVA
- All the talk in marketing and DevOps about MVT and A/B/n is really about ANOVA.
- The statistical procedure of comparing "a continuous outcome on the basis of **one or more categorical predictors**".


## Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)
- [analysis of variance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance) (ANOVA) is a class of [statistical model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_model) used to evaluate the source of variation based on difference between and among groups.
- The method was developed by an evolutionary biologist named [Sir. Ronald A. Fisher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher).
- The most simplist form of ANOVA offers examines if the means of several groups are equal ($\mu_1 = \mu_2 = \dots = \mu_i$), and therfore generalizes to the *t-test*.


## t-test, regression, ANOVA, huh?
- *regression* predicts continuous response variables based 1 or more continuous predictors.
- *ANOVA* predicts a continuous outcome on the basis of **one or more categorical predictors**. 
- the "one or more categorical variables" statement is the differentiator.
- a single bi-level categorical variable would be a two-sample *t-test*. 
- A single categorical predictor with $\geq 3$ levels or $\geq 2$ categorical predictor variables with $N-$levels would be considered an *ANOVA* model.


## From Regression to ANOVA
- In DataSci we use *regression* to predict quantitative response from quantiative predictors.
- No reason we could not include **categorical** predictors.  However,...
<!---
This came from R in Action, p212
-->
- When categorical (factors) are applied the analytical focus usually shifts from prediction to making inferences about group(factors) differences.
- That process of **understanding group differences** is ANOVA
- ANOVA can be used to analyze a variety of experimental and quasi-experimental designs.


## Experimental Design
- Treatment is **between-groups** factor w/ 2 levels (CBT & EMDR)
- Its **b/w groups** because patients are in one or the other treatment
- Value for each is the **dependent** and treatment is the **independent**


\begin{table}[h!]
  \begin{center}
    \caption{\textbf{One-way between-groups ANOVA.} Two treatments: cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) and eye desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR)}
    \label{tab:table1}
    \begin{tabular}{c|c}
      CBT & EMDR \\
      \hline
      s1 & s6\\
      s2 & s7\\
      s3 & s8\\
      s4 & s9\\
      s5 & s10\\
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
\end{table}

## Sample Size
- a [statistics sample](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)) is the set of data points collected or selected from a larger population based in the experiental procedure.
- Because this experiment has equal numbers in both treatments it is called a **balanaced** design.
- the alterantive would be called an **unbalanced** design

\begin{table}[h!]
  \begin{center}
    \caption{\textbf{One-way between-groups ANOVA.} Two treatments: cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) and eye desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR)}
    \label{tab:table1}
    \begin{tabular}{c|c}
      CBT & EMDR \\
      \hline
      s1 & s6\\
      s2 & s7\\
      s3 & s8\\
      s4 & s9\\
      s5 & s10\\
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
\end{table}


## One-way within-group ANOVA
- What if we wanted to evalute the effect of CBT on anxiety overy time
- Place all patients in the CBT group and test them after therapy and then 6 months later.


\begin{table}[h!]
  \begin{center}
    \caption{\textbf{One-way within-groups ANOVA.} One treatment: cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) tested over time}
    \label{tab:table1}
    \begin{tabular}{c||c|c}
      & \multicolumn{2}{|c }{Time}\\
      \hline
      Patient & 5 weeks & 6 months \\
      \hline
      s1 & &\\
      s2 & &\\
      s3 & &\\
      s4 & &\\
      s5 & &\\
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
\end{table}

## One-way within-group ANOVA
- Time is a **within-group** factor with two levels (5 wks, 6 mo)
- The stastical design is called **one-way within group** ANOVA
- Because each subject (sX) is measured $>1$ its called **repeated measures**.

\begin{table}[h!]
  \begin{center}
    \caption{\textbf{One-way within-groups ANOVA.} One treatment: cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) tested over time}
    \label{tab:table1}
    \begin{tabular}{c||c|c}
      & \multicolumn{2}{|c }{Time}\\
      \hline
      Patient & 5 weeks & 6 months \\
      \hline
      s1 & &\\
      s2 & &\\
      s3 & &\\
      s4 & &\\
      s5 & &\\
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
\end{table}


## Two-way factorial ANOVA
- If we were concerned with both treatment differences **and** change over time.
- This new design allows us to look at the impact of therapy (avg'd across time), Time (avg'd across therapy), and interaction between therapy and time.
- The first two are **main effects** and the last is an **interaction effect**.

\begin{table}[h!]
  \begin{center}
    \caption{\textbf{Two-way facatorial ANOVA.} Two treatment CPT and EMDR tested over time, with one between-groups and one within-groups factor}
    \label{tab:table1}
    \begin{tabular}{c|c||c|c}
      & & \multicolumn{2}{|c }{Time}\\
      \hline
      Treatment & Patient & 5 weeks & 6 months \\
      \hline
      CBT & s1 & &\\
      CBT & s2 & &\\
      CBT & s3 & &\\
      EMDR & s4 & &\\
      EMDR & s5 & &\\
      EMDR & s6 & &\\
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
\end{table}


## Two-way factorial ANOVA
- A **factorial design** crosses $\geq2$ factors.
- When crossing both between-group and within-groups factors, its called a **mixed-model** ANOVA.
- So this experiment is a **Two-way factorial ANOVA**

\begin{table}[h!]
  \begin{center}
    \caption{\textbf{Two-way facatorial ANOVA.} Two treatment CPT and EMDR tested over time, with one between-groups and one within-groups factor}
    \label{tab:table1}
    \begin{tabular}{c|c||c|c}
      & & \multicolumn{2}{|c }{Time}\\
      \hline
      Treatment & Patient & 5 weeks & 6 months \\
      \hline
      CBT & s1 & &\\
      CBT & s2 & &\\
      CBT & s3 & &\\
      EMDR & s4 & &\\
      EMDR & s5 & &\\
      EMDR & s6 & &\\
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
\end{table}


## Testing a Two-way factorial ANOVA
- This experiment requires 3 **F-tests**: one for Therapy, one for Time and one for Thearpy x Time interactions.
- Recall we applied [**F-tests**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-test) to evalute hypotheses during regression.

\begin{table}[h!]
  \begin{center}
    \caption{\textbf{Two-way facatorial ANOVA.} Two treatment CPT and EMDR tested over time, with one between-groups and one within-groups factor}
    \label{tab:table1}
    \begin{tabular}{c|c||c|c}
      & & \multicolumn{2}{|c }{Time}\\
      \hline
      Treatment & Patient & 5 weeks & 6 months \\
      \hline
      CBT & s1 & &\\
      CBT & s2 & &\\
      CBT & s3 & &\\
      EMDR & s4 & &\\
      EMDR & s5 & &\\
      EMDR & s6 & &\\
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
\end{table}

## Interpreting a Two-way factorial ANOVA test
- If the therapy test is *significant* it indicates that CBT and EMDR differ in their effect on anxiety
- A *significant* test for time indicates that axiety differed from week 5 to 6 months
- Finally, a **significant**interaction indicates that effect on anxiety from week 5 to 6 months was different for two treatments.

\begin{table}[h!]
  \begin{center}
    \caption{\textbf{Two-way facatorial ANOVA.} Two treatment CPT and EMDR tested over time, with one between-groups and one within-groups factor}
    \label{tab:table1}
    \begin{tabular}{c|c||c|c}
      & & \multicolumn{2}{|c }{Time}\\
      \hline
      Treatment & Patient & 5 weeks & 6 months \\
      \hline
      CBT & s1 & &\\
      CBT & s2 & &\\
      CBT & s3 & &\\
      EMDR & s4 & &\\
      EMDR & s5 & &\\
      EMDR & s6 & &\\
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
\end{table}


## Advanced ANOVA designs
- There are other ANOVA designs that extend this logic further.
- For instance if you had **prior** knowledge of patients, for instance they conducted a self-test on themselves this would be a **confounding** factor or a **nuisance** parameter.
- We could treat this **nuisance** parameter as a **covariate** and analyze this experiment using an [**analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_covariance).
- If you used $>1$ dependent variable in the study, to increase validity we could apply a [**multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis_of_variance) 
- And with covariates [**multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MANCOVA).


## Fitting an ANOVA model
- The similarities between **ANOVA** and **regression** show that we could use `lm()` to conduct an ANOVA.
- However, the `aov()` function has the same results and presents findings in a format relevant to ANOVA
- The syntax of the `aov()` function is:
```
aov(formula, data=dataframe)
```

## R symbology
- the $\sim$ symbol seperates the response from the explanatory variables
$$
y \sim A + B + C
$$
- the : denotes interacations between variables
$$
y \sim A + B + A:B
$$
- the * denotes complete crossing. $y \sim A*B*C$ expands to
$$
y \sim A + B + C + A:B + A:C + B:C + A:B:C
$$
- the . denotes all remaining variables. So $y \sim .$ expands to
$$ 
y \sim A + B + C
$$


## Formula for common research designs
- One-way ANOVA
$$
y \sim A
$$
- One-way ANCOVA with 1 covariate
$$
y \sim x + A
$$
- Two-way factorial ANOVA
$$
y \sim A*B
$$
- Two-way factorial ANCOVA with 2 covariates
$$
y \sim x1 + x2 + A * B
$$


## Advanced research design formulas
- Randomized block
$$
y \sim B + A(where B is a blocking factors)
$$
- One-way within-groups ANOVA
$$
y \sim A + Error(Subject/A)
$$
- Repeated measures ANOVA with 1 within-groups factor (W) and 1 between-groups factor (B)
$$
y \sim B * W + Error(Subject/A)
$$


## Formula order
- Order is important under two circumstances: 1.) $>1$ factor and unbalanced design, and 2.) covariates are present.
- Either of these conditions result in correlated factors being on the right side of the equation.
- There are three ways approaches to partitioning variance in $y$ among the effects:
- Type I: sequential, effects are adjusted for the ones that come earlier
- Type II: hierarchical, effects are adjusted for other effects a lower levels
- Type III: marginal, each effect is adjusted for other effects in the model.
- `R` uses a Type I approach by default. SAS and SPSS use Type III by default.
- The `car::Anova()` allows for specifying the TYPE II or III if you are matching results with SAS or SPSS


## One-way ANOVA example
```{r, message=FALSE}
library(multcomp); library(gplots)
attach(cholesterol)
head(cholesterol)
```


## One-way ANOVA example
```{r}
table(trt)               #Group sample sizes
```


## One-way ANOVA example
```{r}
aggregate(response, by=list(trt), FUN=mean) # Group means
aggregate(response, by=list(trt), FUN=sd) # Group std. dev
```

## One-way ANOVA example
```{r}
fit <- aov(response ~ trt)
summary(fit)
```


## One-way ANOVA example
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=5, fig.height=5}
plotmeans(response ~ trt, xlab = "Treatment", ylab = "Response",
          main="Mean Plot with 95% CI")
detach(cholesterol)
```


## Mutliple comparisons
- The **F-test** results:

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results="asis", comment=FALSE}
library(xtable); options(xtable.comment = FALSE)
xtable(anova(fit))
```
- Indicate a difference in the efficacy of drug treatments.
- They do not indicate **which** treatments differ.
- This is the purpose of **multiple comparisons**

## Multiple comparisons
```{r}
TukeyHSD(fit)
```


## Multiple comparisons
```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height=5, fig.align='center'}
par(las=2); par(mar=c(5,8,4,2)); plot(TukeyHSD(fit))
```


##
- alternative plot in the `multcomp()` package
```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height=5, fig.align='center'}
par(mar=c(5,4,6,2)); tuk <- glht(fit, linfct=mcp(trt="Tukey"))
plot(cld(tuk, level=.05),col="lightgrey")
```


## ANOVA assumptions
- the validity of the results of any statistical test is dependent on how well the data fits the test assumptions
- In ANOVA the underlying assumption is that the dependent variable (response) is normally distributed and has equal variance in each group.
- To evaluate this we use a **Q-Q plot**

## Q-Q Plot
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=5, fig.height=5, fig.align='center'}
library(car)
qq.plot(lm(response ~ trt, data=cholesterol))
```
