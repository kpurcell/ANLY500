# Science & Research

---


## What is science?

- big question, lots of answers
- defined according to Bhattacherjee as:
 + contributes to body of science
 + follows scientific method
- assuming a familiarity w/scientific method if not [review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method)

## Types of Science

- The word **Science** derives from the Latin *scientia* meaning knowledge
- Knowledge is diverse -> so is science
- Differences between natural sciences and social sciences?

## Natural vs. Social sciences

- natural sciences tend to be precise, accurate, deterministic
- social sciences tend to lack precision, are less deterministic and more ambiguous.


## Basic vs Applied

- Basic sciences (pure sciences) explain essential physical, chemical, and biological forces.
- Applied sciences study applications of the laws, theories, and results of the basic sciences.
- Overly, simplistic dichotomy!


## [Pasteur's quadrant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasteur%27s_quadrant)

## Operational Goal of Science

- discover laws
- postulate theories
- explain natual and social phenomena
- expand scientific knowledge

## 

> "Somtimes there may not be a single universal truth, but rather an equilibrium of  "multiple truths"". 

## The equilibrium of "multiple truths"

- This is an esoteric concept
- There is a continum of knowledge in science.  
- Theories are being created and destroyed, improved and dispelled.
- Therefore the progress of science is defined by a progression of improvement marked by experimentation and logical reasoning.

## Inductive vs Deductive research

- **Inductive** - goal of inferring theory from observed data
- **Deductive** - goal of testing theory using experimental data
- Difference is *theory-building*(inductive) & *theory-testing*(deductive)
- In reality they are quite often mixed

## Experience is the teacher

- The cycle of research (Fig 1.1, pg 4) is essential to the progression of science
- Both *theory-building* and *theory-testing* are crucial to advancement
- Example: Karl Marx's theory of communism
