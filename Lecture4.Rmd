# Term Projects


## Project objectives

- Apply what you are learning in ANLY 500.
- A professional application
- Involve the entire research process

## Project Deliverables

- Project Proposal (Oct 17)
- Project Analysis (Nov 25)
- Project Presentation (Dec 5)


## Project Proposal

- Based on Ch. 3 of Methods Text
- 2-page proposal
- I will distribute a proposal template
- Should outline 3 phases of research

## Questions?



# Ch. 3: The Research Process


## Paradigms of Research

- **Paradigm** a belief system, mental model, or frame of reference
- popularized by **Thomas Kuhn** in *The Structure of Scientific Theory*

![book](http://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/images/kuhn.jpg)


## Why are they important?

- differing preceptions
- Defines how to evaluate a question
- Therefore, how an analysis is interpreted

## Popular Paradigms

- **Positivism** - derives from Auguste Comte (1789-1857)
- Science (knowledge creation) should be restricted to what can be observed & measured
- Positivism lead to Empiricism (blind faith in observable facts)

- **Post-positivism** - mid-20^th^ century. Argues for combining empirical observation and logical reasoning
- Science is not certain, but probabilistic


## What lead to Post-positivism

- Inability to quantify some variables (human thought/emotion)

## Subjective vs Objective

- **Objective** research pulls the researchers opinions and evaluations out of the work and relied strictly on observable, quantifiable information
- **Subjective** research allows for researcher interpretation, such as in interviews, and surveys (more common in social science than in natural scieneces)

## Functionalist Paradigm

- most research in social & natual sciences lies in this area
- Analytics and segmented sales data vs NLP and product review comments

## Research Process

- Observation - observe social & natural phenomena
- Rationalization - make sense of observed phenomena
- Validation - test our theories with scientific method


##

> Most traditional research tends to be deductive and functionalistic in nature

## Three phases of research

- Exploration
- Research Design
- Research Execution

## Exploration

- selecting research questions
- literature review (id theory, existing work)


## Research Design

- creating research methods
- **Operationalization** - designing measures for research constructs
- Methods - survey, experiment or combo.
- Sampling strategy - how to measure the population with a sample


## Research Proposal

- not a phase as an outcome
- Details the outcome of the Exploration and Design phases

## Research Execution

- Pilot test - a small scale operationally similar methods test that evaluates the research proposal
- Data analysis - After full experiment or data collection the analysis process begins.

## Resarch Report

- Again not a phase as much as an output
- But a crucial part of the research cycle
- Something very familiar to analytics students


## Questions?


# Data Manipulation with R


## Working with Data

- we have reviewed how to get your data into `R`
- Today we will learn how to handle data in `R` 

```{r}
# Lets find out whats loaded in my session
search()
```

- look at `packages:datasets`


## datasets package

- The `datasets` package offers lots of generic data
- a full list can be obtained by 
```
data()
```
- For more info use 
```
help("datasets")
```
- This is where you go (https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/00Index.html)

## Data orientation

- We will start with the `mtcars` data again
- Most datasets you interact with you will **not** have collected
- You will need to get familiar with its structure

## 
- What are column headers

```{r}
# What are the vectors or column headers in mtcars
names(mtcars)
```

## 
- look at the top
```{r}
head(mtcars)
```

- look at the bottom of the data 
```{r}
tail(mtcars)
```

## 
- what is the structure 
```{r}
str(mtcars)
```

##
- what are the dimensions
```{r}
dim(mtcars)
```


## Data summaries

- often it is valuable to summarize data
- Utilitiy of summaries are positively correlated w/ data size
- Patterns are **impossible** to detect visually with large data

##
```{r}
# Summary of dataset
summary(mtcars)

# Summary of variable
summary(mtcars$carb)
```


## Bracket Notation

- syntax for indexing or referencing specific data in `R`
- We have already introduced this concept in earlier lectures
- now we will apply `[row,column]` or **Bracket notation** for subsetting and exploring data

## Viewing data by index
```{r}
# View the first row of data
mtcars[1,]

# A couple of rows
mtcars[4:10,]

# Value in first row only first column
mtcars[1,1]
```




##
```{r}
# What are the third to fifth variables in mtcars
names(mtcars)
# Summary of subset of mtcars
summary(mtcars[3:5])
```

## Filtering data

- bracket notation is also powerful for **filtering** data
```{r}
# View data on cars with 6 cylinders
 mtcars[mtcars$cyl=="6",]
```


## Sorting data
```{r}
# sort by mpg
mtcars[order(mtcars$mpg),]
```

## Sorting data
```{r}
# sort by mpg and cyl
mtcars[order(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$cyl),]
```

## Sorting data
```{r}
#sort by mpg (ascending) and cyl (descending)
mtcars[order(mtcars$mpg, -mtcars$cyl),] 
```


## Package Hmisc

- A nice package for data analysis
- include lots of useful utility functions
##
```{r, message=FALSE}
# Load Hmisc
library(Hmisc)
# Use describe() function
describe(mtcars[1])  # using bracket notation
describe(mtcars$mpg) # direct variable reference
```


##
```{r, message=FALSE}
library(fBasics) # Load package
basicStats(mtcars[3:5])
```


## Cross Tabulation
- tool for comparison between categorical variables
- AKA: Contingency Tables
- For mtcars, we are treating two `num` as categoricals

##
```{r}
# Find levels
unique(mtcars$gear)
unique(mtcars$cyl)

# Show counts by contingency
table(mtcars$gear, mtcars$cyl)
```

##
```{r}
library(gmodels)  # Offers tools for model fitting
CrossTable(mtcars$gear, mtcars$cyl, 
           prop.t=TRUE, # include table of proportions
           prop.r=TRUE, # include row proportions
           prop.c=TRUE) # include column proportions
```


## Viewing Data
- Often there is not replacement for viewing data
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- `R` offers easier, faster EDA than any alternative
- Highly repeatable in comparison to GUI options which are not repeatable at all


## 
```{r, fig.height=6, fig.width=6}
# Pairs plot in base graphics
pairs(mtcars[3:5])
```



## 
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=6, fig.height=6}
# Scatterplot Matrices from the car Package
library(car)
scatterplotMatrix(~mpg+disp+drat+wt|cyl, data=mtcars,
  	main="Three Cylinder Options")
```


## Next Class

- Further develop our EDA abilities 
- Discuss the readings on data management
- Discuss readings on data visualization
- Introduce the `ggplot2()` package
- R assignment will be done in-class, while I discuss research proposals
