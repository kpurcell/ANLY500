## Lecture 6

- Conclude an introduction to EDA
- Review research proposals
- Work on R assignment


# Exploratory Data Analysis

## Boxplots
- Graphical depictions of groups of numerical data through their quartiles. 
- Box plots may have lines extending indicating variability outside the upper and lower quartiles
- Hence the terms box-and-whisker plot and box-and-whisker diagram.

##
```{r}
# Boxplot of MPG by Car Cylinders 
boxplot(mpg~cyl,data=mtcars, main="Car Milage Data", 
  	xlab="Number of Cylinders", ylab="Miles Per Gallon")
```


##
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.height=5, fig.width=6}
# Notched Boxplot of Tooth Growth Against 2 Crossed Factors
# boxes colored for ease of interpretation 
boxplot(len~supp*dose, data=ToothGrowth, notch=TRUE, 
  col=(c("gold","darkgreen")),
  main="Tooth Growth", xlab="Suppliment and Dose")
```

## Violin Plots
- are a [non-parametric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonparametric_statistics) way to estimate the [probability density function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_density_function) of a given variable.  
- Basically a box plot with a probability density plot included

##
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=5, fig.height=5}
# Violin Plots
library(vioplot); 
x1 <- mtcars$mpg[mtcars$cyl==4];x2 <- mtcars$mpg[mtcars$cyl==6];x3 <- mtcars$mpg[mtcars$cyl==8]
vioplot(x1, x2, x3, names=c("4 cyl", "6 cyl", "8 cyl"), 
   col="gold")
title("Violin Plots of Miles Per Gallon")
```



## QQ Plots
- Is a visual assessment of the assumption of normality
- Essentially a graphical probability plot, which compares two probability distributions by plotting their quantiles against each other. 
- Perfect normality would result in a straight line

##
```{r}
# Q-Q Plot for variable MPG 
qqnorm(mtcars$mpg)
qqline(mtcars$mpg)
```

##
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(car); library(multcomp)
qqPlot(lm(response~ trt, data=cholesterol), 
       simulate=TRUE, main="Q-Q Plot", labels=FALSE)

```


## Dot plots
- a representation of a distribution with groups of data points plotted on a simple scale. 
- Dot plots are used for continuous, quantitative, univariate data. 


##
```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=5.5}
# Simple Dotplot
dotchart(mtcars$mpg,labels=row.names(mtcars),cex=.7,
  	main="Gas Milage for Car Models", 
   xlab="Miles Per Gallon")
```


##
```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Kabacoff 2015, p. 134
x <- mtcars[order(mtcars$mpg),]
x$cyl <- factor(x$cyl)

x$color[x$cyl==4] <- "red"
x$color[x$cyl==6] <- "blue"
x$color[x$cyl==8] <- "darkgreen"

dotchart(x$mpg,
         labels = row.names(x),
         cex = .7,
         groups = x$cyl,
         gcolor = "black",
         color = x$color,
         pch=19,
         main = "Gass Mileage for Car Models\ngrouped by cylinder",
         xlab = "Miles per Gallon")
```

- sorted by `mpg`, grouped & colored by `cyl`


# Merging Data


## Merging data

- One of the most common problems in analytics is "data in disparate locations"
- This means the relevant data for a given problem is managed in different repositories
- Could be within the same storage structure or from totally different software platforms
- Typically solved using a **RDMS** however what if the data is not in the same **RDMS**
- **Key job** of the analyst is to reformat that data and merge it into a usable format


## Merging example

- What tool have we already learned that could merge data?


## Merge example
- The `rbind()` and `cbind()` functions may come to mind.
- **Problem** is that those functions assume you are merging data with the same dimensions.
- What is you have a table of sales data for certain customers, and then a table of customer data?

## Merge function `base`
```
merge(x, y, by = intersect(names(x), names(y)),
      by.x = by, by.y = by, all = FALSE, all.x = all, all.y = all,
      sort = TRUE, suffixes = c(".x",".y"),
      incomparables = NULL, ...)
```

- id the two data frames
- specify the `by =` or the **key** or **keys**
- cool use the `intersect()` fxn inside the `by =` parameter
- other options...


##
```{r}
dataA <- data.frame(x=c("A", "B","C"), y=c(10, 20, 30))
dataB <- data.frame(x=c("A", "B","C"), z=c(40, 50, 60))
dataC <- merge(dataA, dataB, by = "x")
dataC  #view the merged data
```


# Reshaping data

## Data restructuring
- Often data needs to be restructured into a valuable format
- That restucturing could require aggregation (if formula does not result in a singular value)


## 
```{r}
id <- c(1,1,2,2)
time <- c(1,2,1,2)
x1 <- c(5,6,7,8)
x2 <- c(9,10,11,12)

wide.data <- data.frame(id,time,x1,x2)
wide.data
```

## Melted data
```{r}
library(reshape2)
melt.data <- melt(wide.data, id=c("id","time"))
melt.data
```

## Casted data 
```{r}
# cast the melted data using cast(data, formula, function) 
casted.data <- dcast(melt.data, id + time~variable)
casted.data
```


## Aggregated cast
```{r}
# cast the melted data using cast(data, formula, function) 
subjmeans <- dcast(melt.data, id~variable, mean)
subjmeans
timemeans <- dcast(melt.data, time~variable, mean)
timemeans
```


# Data Visualization

## EDA quality graphics
```{r, echo=FALSE}

plot(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Sepal.Width)

```

## Both Graphics made with R

- difference between the two graphic is the settings and annotations
- there is tremendous power built into R to create powerful detailed graphics
- We will review the **basics** but you must experiment in order to really get to be an expert.

## 
```{r, fig.width=7, fig.height=5}
# 4 figures arranged in 2 rows and 2 columns
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(mtcars$wt,mtcars$mpg, main="Scatterplot of wt vs. mpg")
plot(mtcars$wt,mtcars$disp, main="Scatterplot of wt vs disp")
hist(mtcars$wt, main="Histogram of wt")
boxplot(mtcars$wt, main="Boxplot of wt")
```

##
```{r, fig.width=7, fig.height=5}
# 3 figures arranged in 3 rows and 1 column
par(mfrow=c(3,1)) 
hist(mtcars$wt)
hist(mtcars$mpg)
hist(mtcars$disp)
```


##
```{r, warning=FALSE}
# Add boxplots to a scatterplot
par(fig=c(0,0.8,0,0.8), new=TRUE)
plot(mtcars$wt, mtcars$mpg, xlab="Car Weight",
  ylab="Miles Per Gallon")
par(fig=c(0,0.8,0.55,1), new=TRUE)
boxplot(mtcars$wt, horizontal=TRUE, axes=FALSE)
par(fig=c(0.65,1,0,0.8),new=TRUE)
boxplot(mtcars$mpg, axes=FALSE)
mtext("Enhanced Scatterplot", side=3, outer=TRUE, line=-3)
```
